### Hey, you! 👋

According to my guesses, you are reading my own README. Did I guess it right? 👀 

Anyways, if you wonder who am I, (because you are here for that, isn't it lol 😄) I'm a developer (and designer a bit if you say so) from Ankara, Turkey 🇹🇷 named Yusuf Cihan. (he / him) I love to creating new unique things that has not been made before. Maybe that's why I'm busy most of the times than usual, who knows. ⏱ You can check my projects here. And you can star them when you feel generous. Because it is free to ⭐, so why not :)

I can say I'm mostly using Python, because it is powerful (at least for me). 😁 But I also use Java, C#, JavaScript sometimes too.
